The Higher-Lower game is a simple yet addictive guessing game that tests your intuition and knowledge.
How It Works
Two Choices Appear:

Example: "Google" vs "Tesla"

You Guess:

Which one has higher search volume?

Correct Guess:

You move on to the next round with a new comparison.

Wrong Guess:

Game over! Your score is the number of correct guesses in a row.
